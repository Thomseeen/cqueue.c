# TSQUEUE-C
My take on a thread safe FIFO queue providing `push`, `pop` and `len` functions. Build to be used with another project of mine.

The `MAKEFILE` (for Unix `gcc`) compiles a test and example program from the `test.c` to test and showcase the use of the queue.

Feel free to report bugs and suggest improvements by opening an issue or directly opening a pull request.
